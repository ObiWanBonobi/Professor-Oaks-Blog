# Introduction

I wanted to create a fun blog with a social aspect to it. My vision for this blog was a social place where people who enjoy pokemon can read fun blog posts and connect with fellow pokemon lovers. I wanted the website to be visually pleasing, that is intuitive and easy to navigate.

## User experience

As a user I can :
- Enjoy reading fun blog posts
- Enjoy the pokemon database and learn more about my favourite pokemons
- Create my own profile
- Communicate with friends
- Follow friends

# Design

### Colour scheme

I wanted to keep the colours fun and matching with the pokemon theme. The main pages follow the design of a pokeball, red - black - white. Other features like the back up button and the delete modal follow the pokemon logo colours, blue - yellow

<img src="static/images/readme/pokeball.webp" width="150px"><img src="static/images/International_Pokémon_logo.webp" width="450px">

## balsemiq

I ended up slightly veering away from the original design, only because I miscalculated the time I needed for each feature. I have placed these features into the future features list, seeing as that I still want to add these features in the future.

# Testing

All the tests are in the [TEST.md](TEST.md) file.

<br>


# Bug fixes

- I had accidentally added the path to the post_detail page outside of the urlpatterns brackets.
- There was a bug that would throw an error when the socials page is clicked when a user isn't logged in. That got fixed with an if else statement.
- If a user would comment on a post and then refresh, the comment would duplicate. I had to add HttpResponseRedirect to the comment form.
- After I would update my profile picture it would return me to the incorrect user profile. I had to return the correct user pk.
- The update profile message wans't showing, I had placed the message code in the wrong section.
- The edit comment button stopped working, because I had accidentally deleted the .id in the comment.
- I wasn't able to test the first time, with the help of a tutor from the code institute. We figured out it was an migration issue and a database issue.
- A user could update other peoples profiles when adding /update_profile/(user pk number). I had deleted a previous solution to this, because it wasn't working on VS Code. Turns out I had placed the UserPassesTestMixin in the wrong order. So I added it back in.

<b>I have not noticed any existing bugs.</b>
